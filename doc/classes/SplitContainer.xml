	<description>
		A container that arranges child controls horizontally or vertically and creates grabbers between them. The grabbers can be dragged around to change the size relations between the child controls.

				Clamps the [member split_offsets] values to not go outside the possible minimum and maximum values, and to not overlap with each other.

		<member name="collapsed" type="bool" setter="set_collapsed" getter="is_collapsed" default="false">
			If [code]true[/code], the [Control] nodes will be set to their default positions (as if all [member split_offsets] were set to [code]0[/code]) and the draggers are disabled.

		<member name="dragger_visibility" type="int" setter="set_dragger_visibility" getter="get_dragger_visibility" enum="SplitContainer.DraggerVisibility" default="0">
			Determines the dragger's visibility. See [enum DraggerVisibility] for details.

		<member name="split_offset" type="int" setter="set_split_offset" getter="get_split_offset" default="0" deprecated="Use [member split_offsets] instead. The first element of the array is the split offset between the first two children.">
			The first element of [member split_offsets].

		<member name="split_offsets" type="PackedInt32Array" setter="set_split_offsets" getter="get_split_offsets" default="PackedInt32Array(0)">
			Offsets for each dragger in pixels. Each one is the offset of the split between the [Control] nodes before and after the dragger, with [code]0[/code] being the default position. The default position is based on the [Control] nodes expand flags and minimum sizes. See [member Control.size_flags_horizontal], [member Control.size_flags_vertical], and [member Control.size_flags_stretch_ratio].
			If none of the [Control] nodes before the dragger are expanded, the default position will be at the start of the [SplitContainer]. If none of the [Control] nodes after the dragger are expanded, the default position will be at the end of the [SplitContainer]. If the dragger is in between expanded [Control] nodes, the default position will be in the middle, based on the [member Control.size_flags_stretch_ratio]s and minimum sizes.
			[b]Note:[/b] If the split offsets cause [Control] nodes to overlap, the first split will take priority when resolving the positions.
		</member>
		<member name="vertical" type="bool" setter="set_vertical" getter="is_vertical" default="false">
			If [code]true[/code], the [SplitContainer] will arrange its children vertically, rather than horizontally.
			Can't be changed when using [HSplitContainer] and [VSplitContainer].
